- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Wes4All
- I game and mod most platforms except xbox and sega
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently preparing for the Comptia A+ exam and plan to continue on to the Network+

For starters i am documenting my RetroPie arcade machine prject from 2017-2018ish.
This started from a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ and is built within a case with a cooling fan and power button attached to certain pins.
Its based off the retropie project with few files modified for power button functionality.

Going to start building projects here publicly, and will be positng consoles ive modded in the past.

modded switch content should start to build here soon. it will mostly be backups of my own programs like retroarch.
