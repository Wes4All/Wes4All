- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Wes4All
- I game and mod most platforms except xbox and sega
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the basic Comptia A+ exam and plan to continue to Network+ next

For starters i am documenting my RetroPie arcade machine prject from 2017-2018ish.
This started from a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ and is built within a case with a cooling fan and power button attached to certain pins.
Its based off the retropie project with few files modified for power button functionality.
